      Pork Menudo is the number one on the list of my comfort foods and it’s
      hard for me to last a month without trying one – literally. Some would say
      that I am addicted to this food while others would use the term
      “obsession”, I just simply look at it as a necessity – a basic necessity
      that I cannot live without.
